# Online Shopping Page

This repository contains a simple online shopping web page built using React and the Redux Toolkit for state management. The page showcases a variety of products that users can explore, add to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

 The Redux Toolkit is utilized to manage the state of the shopping cart and enhance user experience. Tailwind CSS is employed for easy and responsive styling. API fetching techniques are used to load product data dynamically.
